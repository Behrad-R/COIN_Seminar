The final versions of the notebooks for the classification and regression approaches. Version control was mainly done in Google Colab, Kaggle or manually.
Executed versions (with and without obvious cases) and the dataset can be found in the following Kaggle notebooks:

- Regression approach: https://www.kaggle.com/code/behradrajabiefumani/coin-seminar-lr-scheduler-v2
- Binary classification approach: https://www.kaggle.com/code/behradrajabiefumani/coin-seminar-classification-binary
- Binary classification with obvious cases: https://www.kaggle.com/code/behradrajabiefumani/coin-seminar-classification-binary-with-edge-cases
- Multi-class approach: https://www.kaggle.com/code/behradrajabiefumani/coin-seminar-multi-classification
- Multi-class with obvious cases: https://www.kaggle.com/code/behradrajabiefumani/coin-seminar-multi-classification-with-edge-cases
- Dataset (private with link sharing for privacy reasons): https://kaggle.com/datasets/0d9cd00194b27c971b3436bc459c98f0bd36c82f5975b66f1601d7f8332e14d3

The notebooks "Regression R2 Score of 23.ipynb" and "Regression R2 Score of 25.ipynb" contain old versions of the code with the best results reached. A version of the classification notebooks without filtering the obvious cases is included to compare the results with eachother. Furthermore, to show that the results are likely different because of the data and not because of badly set parameters.
